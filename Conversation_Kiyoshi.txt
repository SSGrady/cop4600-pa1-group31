Can you create round robinIntroductionYou are tasked with implementing three process scheduling algorithms: FIFO (First In, First Out), Pre-emptive SJF (Shortest Job First), and Round Robin in Python, but using ChatGPT. ChatGPT's implementation should be able to simulate the scheduling of multiple processes under each algorithm and calculate their turnaround time, response time, and wait time.ChatGPT's implementation should include the following components:A data structure to represent a process, including its arrival time, execution time, and status.A scheduler function for each algorithm that takes in a list of processes and implements the chosen scheduling algorithm.A time slice parameter (Q-value) for Round Robin, which determines how long each process should be allowed to run before being preempted.A function to calculate our standard metrics: turnaround time, waiting time, and response time for each process.You will be provided with test inputs and outputs to use as a benchmark for your results.Each member of your team will be responsible for providing at least one prompt. You are allowed multiple iterations. You may continue to refine your prompt as much as necessary in order to get desirable results. You are encouraged to compare prompts as a team to arrive at a "best solution" for final submission. However, you will be required to keep and track your prompt history (see below).At some point, it may seem like continuing prompt iteration yields diminishing returns. At your discretion, you may choose to stop prompting and complete the project on your own. Ideally, human-written code would be limited to output formatting and other superficial, minor tweaks. However, there may be some features or aspects of the project which perhaps ChatGPT refuses to generate. These should be clearly documented. All cases of human-generated code should be commented as such.Finally, as a caution -- ChatGPT, at least as implemented at OpenAI.com, will occasionally refuse to generate code literally telling you that it can't. You can rephrase your prompt or even just ask it to carry it out regardless ("You've done this before. Please do it now").Input File FormatExample:processcount 3  # Read 3 processesrunfor 20       # Run for 20 time unitsuse sjfprocess name A arrival 0 burst 5process name B arrival 1 burst 4process name C arrival 4 burst 2enddirective	definitionprocesscount	Number of processes in the listrunfor	How many time ticks to run in totaluse	The algorithm to use. Valid values: fcfs, sjf, rrquantum	(for rr only) length of the quantum in time ticksprocess	see belowend	end of file markerThe process takes three named parameters:name: The name of your process. This can be any valid string.arrival: The arrival time of the processburst: Total burst timeRemember to check the validity of the use and quantum parameters:If use specifies 'rr' and there is no quantum specified, print an error message and exit.In general, if any of the required parameters are missing, print an error and exit.Error message should be in the form of:  Error: Missing parameter <parameter>.In the case of missing quantum parameter when use is 'rr' print:  Error: Missing quantum parameter when use is 'rr'If the input file is not provided:Print a usage message:   Usage: scheduler-get.py <input file>Output File FormatExample:3 processesUsing preemptive Shortest Job FirstTime   0 : A arrivedTime   0 : A selected (burst   5)Time   1 : B arrivedTime   4 : C arrivedTime   5 : A finishedTime   5 : C selected (burst   2)Time   7 : C finishedTime   7 : B selected (burst   4)Time  11 : B finishedTime  11 : IdleTime  12 : IdleTime  13 : IdleTime  14 : IdleTime  15 : IdleTime  16 : IdleTime  17 : IdleTime  18 : IdleTime  19 : IdleFinished at time  20A wait   0 turnaround   5  response 0B wait   6 turnaround  10  response 6C wait   1 turnaround   3 response 1Output must include all of the following:Number of processesThe algorithm usedWhen Round Robin is selected, print the Quantum on a separate line immediately following the display of the algorithm used.Every time tick which experiences an event (i.e. processes arrived, selected, and finished)When the CPU is not used, print "Idle"Note the last time tick.In your experimentation, you may have processes that don't complete within the given runtime. List those unfinished processes on the final summary line asP1 did not finishThe sample output shows all numerical outputs neatly right-justified. You do not need to do so. Whitespace between elements will suffice without fancy alignment. i.e.:Time  1Time  10Handling input and outputInputYour script must accept a single command-line parameter for the input filename. i.e.:scheduler-gpt.py inputFile.inFilename must be the only and required parameter. The input filename should have the extension of ".in".OutputYour script will write out the output file as the base filename with the extension of ".out" i.e.:inputFile.in should result in an output file called inputFile.outTest Filespa1-testfiles.zipDownload pa1-testfiles.zipDeliverablesEach member of the team must provide link(s) to their conversation history. We want to see how the discussion evolves over time as you refine your query. Each individual conversation should be submitted as a link to chat.openai.com:Each conversation is listed on the left-hand side.  Each entry has a menu button.  Select that, and then select "Share."  You can then copy a link to the conversation.The team will then evaluate each conversation and determine the best path forward to the final code.  This could be by picking the best result from the conversations submitted or it could be a hybrid of all of them.  Whatever method is chosen, it should be documented and justified.  Why and how did you arrive at the final result?  This should be documented in your final report.The final report in which the team evaluates not only the final output, but the process of coding via generative AI. Only a single report is required for the entire team, in either Word or PDF format. All team members should be listed at the top followed by all links to the ChatGPT conversations.  It should be titled "Group-N Final Report.docx" (or .pdf) where N is your Group Number.  See below for the evaluation rubric.The final code to be evaluated as a single Python file named scheduler-gpt.py Team member names should be listed at the top of the file as comments.Evaluation of AI CodeWhen evaluating AI-generated code, it's important to keep in mind that the code may not always be optimal or free of errors, and that human review is still necessary to ensure that the code meets the intended criteria and requirements. You will provide a written report of your team's evaluation of ChatGPT's output using the following rubric:Correctness: Does the code perform the intended task correctly? Are there any bugs or errors that need to be fixed?Efficiency: Is the code efficient and avoid unnecessary computations or data structures? Can the code be optimized for better performance?Readability: Is the code well-organized, well-documented, and easy to understand? Does the code follow best practices such as using meaningful variable names, avoiding code duplication, and use a consistent coding style between prompts?Completeness: Does the code handle edge cases and error conditions appropriately? Is the code flexible enough to handle different input data and scenarios? What happens when you don't feed it an input file or a malformed input file? Does the code account for race conditions (i.e. when two processes can technically be scheduled at the same time)?Innovation: Does the code offer any new or innovative approaches or ideas for solving the problem at hand? Does the code leverage any new or emerging technologies or frameworks?Overall Quality and Final Recommendation: Based on the above criteria, how would you rate the overall quality of the code? Would you recommend any changes or improvements to make the code more effective or efficient? How would you rate your overall experience writing code using the assistance of an AI? Was it easier or harder than you expected? What did you learn through the process? What would you do differently if you had to write code via AI again?Grading RubricCorrectness of Final Code (30 points)In order to avoid low-effort prompts and to encourage good code generation, your final output will be run against sample files and tested for their correctness. Your code will be run once against each of the algorithms. 10 points for each algorithm. Points will be deduced for incorrect outputs.Prompt and Conversation Submissions from all Members (10 points)4 points for all members contributing conversations, proportional points for partial submissions.6 points for quality of conversations demonstrating an iterative process of refinement along with well-reasoned and well-documented explanations for how the final product came to be.Addressing Each Point of Evaluation (60 points total)10 points each. Points will be awarded on the basis of coherence and insight. Full points will demonstrate engagement with the topic and thoughtful, well-written response.Bonus Points (10 points)Generated Code implements novel features such as:Enhanced output rendering. This can be through the use of HTML, Markdown, or terminal codes to implement tables, colored text, or even animation.Other scheduling algorithms like Linux's CFS.Enhanced interface like a GUI.User-generated code may also implement new features. As this assignment is in its beta test stage, I would eventually like to compare the efficiency of AI-generated base code with human-written enhancements versus trying to let the AI write all of the code. Which is easier and/or faster?ChatGPT said:Here's the implementation for Round Robin, FIFO (FCFS), and Preemptive SJF process scheduling in Python, following your specifications. The script reads an input file, simulates scheduling, and generates an output file.Process SchedulingThis Python script implements FIFO, Preemptive SJF, and Round Robin scheduling algorithms, handling input parsing, scheduling logic, and formatted output. It validates parameters and ensures the correct format of results. Let me know if you need refinements!You said:so how would I make it work?ChatGPT said:How to Run the SchedulerFollow these steps to execute the process scheduling script and generate results:1??

Let me know! ??You said:these are what the test files .zip are, what do they mean?ChatGPT said:The test files in the pa1-testfiles-1 folder contain predefined input (.in) and expected output (.out) files for testing your scheduling algorithm implementation.Understanding the Test Files.in Files (Input Files)These contain process scheduling parameters, including:The number of processes.The scheduling algorithm (fcfs, sjf, rr).The total runtime.Processes with arrival times and burst times.Quantum time (for Round Robin).Example: c2-fcfs.in ? A test case for FCFS with 2 processes..out Files (Expected Output)These contain the expected results if the scheduler is working correctly.Includes:Scheduling events (when processes are selected, finished, or when the CPU is idle).Metrics: turnaround time, waiting time, response time.Example: c2-fcfs.out ? The expected output for c2-fcfs.in.File Naming ConventionThe test files are named based on:cX ? Number of processes (e.g., c2 for 2 processes, c5 for 5).fcfs / sjf / rr ? The scheduling algorithm used in the test..in / .out ? Input file or expected output file.ExamplesFilename	Meaningc2-fcfs.in	Input for FCFS with 2 processesc2-fcfs.out	Expected output for c2-fcfs.inc5-rr.in	Input for Round Robin with 5 processesc5-rr.out	Expected output for c5-rr.inHow to Use These FilesRun the Scheduler Using a Test FileshCopyEditpython scheduler-gpt.py c2-fcfs.inThis will generate an output file: c2-fcfs.out.Compare the OutputCheck if your generated c2-fcfs.out matches the provided one in pa1-testfiles-1.If they match, your implementation is correct.If they don't, debug and fix any inconsistencies.Next StepsTry running different test cases (c5-rr.in, c10-fcfs.in).Compare your generated output with the expected .out files.Debug any mismatches to ensure correctness.Let me know if you need help running the tests! ??You said:I need just the round-robin and no other process ChatGPT said:EditedI've modified the script to only support Round Robin scheduling and removed the other scheduling methods. The script now ensures that only the "rr" algorithm is used, and it will exit with an error message if any other algorithm is provided. Let me know if you need any further refinements! ??You said:where do I put it within my python projectChatGPT said:To integrate the Round Robin scheduler script into your PyCharm project, follow these steps:?? Where to Put the Script?Since you have a Python project in PyCharm named PythonProject, you should:Create a new Python file inside the PythonProject directory.Paste the script inside it.?

The final refinements needed are:Remove the extra "Idle" at the end if not neededRight now, Time 14 : Idle appears before Finished at time 15.Check if this is necessary—if not, the last Idle event should be removed.Ensure accurate finishing timeThe expected output says Finished at time 15, but your code currently adds +1 to the last event.If needed, modify the final print statement to ensure the correct finishing time.?? Suggested FixIn write_output(), modify:pythonCopyEditlast_time = max(p.finish_time for p in processes if p.finish_time != -1)if events[-1][1] != "Idle":  # Avoid adding unnecessary Idle time    file.write(f"Time {last_time:3} : Idle\n")file.write(f"Finished at time {last_time}\n\n")  # Ensure correct finish timeThis will only print "Idle" if the last recorded event wasn't already an idle period and will correctly match the expected "Finished at time" output.Next Steps?

Processes are dynamically read from the input fileThe script reads process details (arrival, burst, etc.) from any valid input file.? Round Robin scheduling is applied dynamicallyIt correctly handles arrival times, quantum time slicing, and preemptions without hard-coding specific process names or sequences.? Sorting and event tracking are generalizableThe scheduler dynamically sorts processes by arrival time and maintains a FIFO queue, ensuring fairness.? Handles different numbers of processes & quantum valuesYou can modify processcount, quantum, or add more processes, and it will still work correctly.Next Steps?? Try running different test files, such as:shCopyEditpython scheduler.py pa1-testfiles-1/c5-rr.inpython scheduler.py pa1-testfiles-1/c10-rr.in?? Compare generated .out files against expected outputs.If anything looks off, feel free to share the results! ??
